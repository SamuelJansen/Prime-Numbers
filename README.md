# Prime-Numbers

This was an assigment for a Logic of Programming class.

It make cicles of prime numbers generators.
An more deep analysis can lead to an n-dimentional graph that contains all prime numbers on its external edges and vertices, 
while all possible prime numbers must lie on insider edges and vertices

It was first made in Portugol (compiled on PortugolStudio software of Univali, SP - Brazil).
A simple papper is attached to this repository, with more deep discussion about the code.
